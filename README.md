{Responsive-Portfolio}

Week two's homework assignment had two portions. The first assignment was to make week one's Basic Portfolio mobile responsive.  The challenge was to use media queries to ensure that the portfolio would remain presentable across on different forms of media.  We needed to implement the viewport tag to link the queries to our HTML and this whole exercise was to be done without using Bootstrap.  

The exercise seemed fairly straight-forward but I got stuck for two days, not understanding why my pages weren't doing what I wanted them to do.  I later found that my viewport tag wasn't functioning properly, I believe, because I had cut and pasted the viewport from my notes which had stylized quotation marks.  Even though I had the viewport tag right and the quotation marks in the right place, I learned a valuable lesson that the littlest thing can be extremely important and it can really hold you up for a long time.  

I learned a lot through this exercise.  Mainly just becoming more familiar and comfortable with HTML, CSS, and media queries.
