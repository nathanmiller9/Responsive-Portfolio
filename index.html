                    <p><img id="portfolio" src="assets/images/profile.png" alt="Profile Picture of Nathan">I'm originally from Vienna, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, DC. I grew up playing and enjoying a lot of sports including baseball which was and still is my favorite. I also took on music at a pretty early age. After stints with the piano, cello, oboe, and trumpet, I discovered that I wasn't a terrible singer when I got to college. This led to a lengthy career in independent music where I was fortunate enough to have made recordings and given many performances. Even so, I've always maintained steady work in other disciplines and in the course of that, I've been fortunate to gain experience in a variety of industries.
                        <p>In 2009, I moved to Los Angeles, California, for a new adventure. I still love Washington, DC, but I have grown to love the west coast just as much. I met my wife here and have been married since June, 2016. I continue to write new music and sing from time to time, which I enjoy tremendously.
                            <p>In January, 2017, I embarked on my newest adventure, studying computer programming at UCLA Extension. I am thoroughly enjoying learning new skills and progressing in this new endeavor!
